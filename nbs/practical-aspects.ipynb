    "One of the most common things you do when creating a software package or solving a science problem is to debug your code.  I'm taking 'debug' in the sense of removing problems from your code.  So the natural place to begin is: how do you find bugs?\n",

    "\n",
    "While the most natural way to find problems is to allow them to surface, this is not always the best practice.  Some issues are more subtle than you'd expect / appreciate at first glance.  That is why some people advocate for *test-driven* development. In this paradigm, you must write a battery of tests that cover the entire functionality of the code base.  "
