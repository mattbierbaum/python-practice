    "# Versioning\n",
    "\n",
    "Hard drive space is cheap, your time is not.  As you work, keep track of changes and help others work with you on your project.  One of the easy ways to do this is by using a Version Control System (VCS).  Popular ones include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **git** -- made by Linus T., distributed, light-weight branching, GitHub\n",
    "* **hg** -- mercurial, similar to subversion also popular\n",
    "* **CVS** -- older, branching is a little harder\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look a bit at *git*.  Git is a distributed version control system where each member has a full code history.  Each time a change is made, it is inserted into the history as a *commit*.  These commits can be grouped into larger structures known as *branches* which are off-shoot from a particular point in time.  They often contain a particular feature implementation or a bug fix. The simplest workflow for a single branch, single developer is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    git clone <resource-url>\n",
    "    < edit some files >\n",
    "    git add filename.ext\n",
    "    git commit -m \"an informative message about what you did\"\n",
    "    git push origin master\n",
    "    \n",
    "I am personally a big fan of [this workflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) which maintains a release oriented `master` branch, a `develop` branch which has active development, and `feature` branches for larger changes.  Additionally, this workflow includes `--no-ff` which keeps full branch history around after merges happen. That is, when done with a feature branch:\n",
    "\n",
    "    git checkout -b feature\n",
    "    < make some changes >\n",
    "    git add <files>\n",
    "    git commit -m \"good, descriptive message\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    git checkout develop\n",
    "    git merge --no-ff feature\n",
    "    git branch -d feature\n",
    "    git push origin develop\n",
    "    \n",
    "When working along a single branch I recommend the rebase workflow to allow for easier bisecting to find bugs.  In particular, when working with more than one developer, you may find that they have incorporated changes in between your syncs (via `fetch` or `pull`).  To remedy this, I personally do:\n",
    "\n",
    "    git push origin master\n",
    "         ![rejected] (someone else has pushed and you are not synced)\n",
    "         \n",
    "    git fetch origin\n",
    "    git rebase origin/master\n",
    "    git push origin master\n",
    "\n",
    "This keeps the history mostly linear and makes it easier to track changes.\n",

    "Being able to sit down and understand a code base quickly is important.  To make sure you play well with others, style is important.  Different companies, languages, and individuals have preferred styles.  Python is nice in that there is a well-defined style guide that everyone can use: [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). Some of the suggestions are a little out-dated so take with a grain of salt, but here are a few key points about formatting -\n",
    "\n",
    "* Spaces are preferred (4 to a tab)\n",
    "* Shorter lines are easier to read (when completed correctly)\n",
    "* Avoid extra whitespace\n",
    "* No bare `except`s\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Naming conventions \n",
    "* **`CamelCase`** for classes\n",
    "* **`underscore_lowercase`** for functions and variables (`mixedCase` okay if prevailing style)\n",
    "* **`oneword`** for modules\n",
    "* **`CAPITAL_WORDS`** for constants\n",
    "\n",
    "Comments\n",
    "* `\"\"\"` blockquotes for docstrings\n",
    "* `#` for multiline and (occasional) inline comments\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, it is important to stay 'Pythonic'. Prefer list / dictionary comprehensions for shorter statements, keep ideas separated using whitespace.  Comment in blocks unless necessary. Use parallel structure in code when it is necessary. For example, consider the following three code blocks (NOTE, I did not check to make sure these work):"
